# Maximum of a List

Pretty simple problem - we'll output $n$ distinct integers, you should give us the maximum of this list.

## Input

Input begins with a single integer $n$, the number of elements. 
The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$, the elements of the list.

## Output

Output the largest element $a_i$ of the list, and also a random element from the list that is not $a_i$.

## Constraints

* $2 \leq n \leq 10^5$
* $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^8$
* All elements will be unique
